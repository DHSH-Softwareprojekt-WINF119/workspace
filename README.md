# workspace

:package: VSCode workspace files

## Usage

1. Create a new top-level directory which will serve as a base for all other projects.

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= `12.20.0`, >= `14.13.1` or >= `16.0.0` and run the following:

```
node cli.js
```

A file called `workspace.code-workspace` will be created. Open that file with VSCode.
